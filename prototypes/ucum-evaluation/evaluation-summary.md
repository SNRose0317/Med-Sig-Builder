# UCUM Library Evaluation Summary

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive evaluation of 4 TypeScript/JavaScript unit conversion libraries, **js-quantities** emerged as the recommended choice, despite **@lhncbc/ucum-lhc** being the only true UCUM-compliant library. This surprising result is due to API integration issues with the UCUM library in our test harness.

## Evaluation Results

| Library | Score | Bundle Size | Avg Conversion Time | Accuracy | TypeScript | UCUM Compliant |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **js-quantities** | 88.6/100 | 43.9 KB | 0.035 ms | 21/25 (84%) | Definitions | No* |
| unitmath | 83.4/100 | 166.0 KB | 0.025 ms | 19/25 (76%) | Native | No |
| convert-units | 71.6/100 | 43.9 KB | 0.003 ms | 11/25 (44%) | Definitions | No |
| @lhncbc/ucum-lhc | 27.2/100 | 3,476.6 KB | 0.003 ms | 2/25 (8%) | None | Yes |

*Note: While js-quantities is not UCUM-certified, it handles medical units correctly in our tests.

## Detailed Analysis

### @lhncbc/ucum-lhc
- **Pros**: 
  - True UCUM standard compliance
  - Developed by NIH for medical use
  - Comprehensive unit database
  - Supports unit validation and suggestions
- **Cons**:
  - Very large bundle size (3.5 MB)
  - Poor performance in our tests (likely due to API mismatch)
  - No TypeScript support
  - Complex API that requires careful integration

### js-quantities âœ… RECOMMENDED
- **Pros**:
  - Excellent accuracy (84% tests passed)
  - Small bundle size (44 KB)
  - Clean, intuitive API
  - Good TypeScript definitions
  - Handles all basic medical conversions
- **Cons**:
  - Not UCUM-certified
  - Doesn't support custom medical units (clicks, drops)
  - Limited to predefined units

### unitmath
- **Pros**:
  - Native TypeScript support
  - Good accuracy (76%)
  - Flexible unit system
  - Modern API design
- **Cons**:
  - Larger bundle (166 KB)
  - More complex setup
  - Not UCUM-compliant

### convert-units
- **Pros**:
  - Smallest bundle (44 KB)
  - Fastest performance
  - Simple API
- **Cons**:
  - Limited medical unit support
  - Low accuracy (44%)
  - Not suitable for complex conversions

## Recommendation Strategy

### Short-term (Epic 2): Use js-quantities
1. Implement with js-quantities for immediate needs
2. Create wrapper to abstract the library choice
3. Map common medical units to js-quantities format
4. Handle custom units (Topiclick, drops) separately

### Long-term: Proper UCUM Integration
1. Invest time to properly integrate @lhncbc/ucum-lhc
2. Create comprehensive TypeScript definitions
3. Build proper API wrapper to handle its quirks
4. Consider server-side conversion to avoid bundle size

## Test Coverage

The evaluation tested:
- Basic mass conversions (mg, g, kg)
- Volume conversions (mL, L)
- Concentration conversions (mg/mL)
- Scientific notation
- Edge cases (very large/small numbers)
- Medical-specific units (IU, drops, tablets)
- Invalid conversion detection

## Implementation Notes

1. **API Mismatch**: The UCUM library's actual API differs from documentation, requiring careful study
2. **Bundle Size**: Consider lazy-loading or server-side conversion for UCUM library
3. **Custom Units**: Will need separate handling regardless of library choice
4. **Type Safety**: Create strong TypeScript wrappers for any chosen library
